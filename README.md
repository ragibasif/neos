# 🛠️ Neos

_**neos** - borrowed from Greek neo-, combining form from néos "young, fresh, new" [Merriam-Webster]_

A simple, interactive Bash script to **generate a new project** from a template.

## 🚀 Usage

```bash
./neos.sh
```

## Notes

- Have [Gum](https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum) installed.
- Make sure you have a `templates/` folder in the same directory as the script.
- Template files should use `DEFAULT` as a placeholder name (in file content and optionally in file names).
- Git is optional but recommended for version control.
